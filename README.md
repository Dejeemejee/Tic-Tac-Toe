# Tic-Tac-Toe
 
A tic-tac-toe, otherwise called noughts and crosses, command line game created using solely the ruby programming language. Two players play against each other by entering numbers(rows, columns) to a prompt corresponding to desired positions on the tic-tac-toe board(3 x 3 grid). A player wins when either row, columns or diagonals appear to be of similar letters.

Have fun checking it out!!!!
